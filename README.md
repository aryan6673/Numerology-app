# Numerology App

This Python application calculates your numerology number based on your birthdate and provides insights into its meaning.

## Features

- Enter your birthdate (DD-MM-YYYY).
- Calculate your numerology number by summing the digits of your birthdate.
- Display a description of the significance of the numerology number.

## Requirements

This app runs on Python 3.6 or later.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan6673/Numerology-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Numerology-app
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter your birthdate in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`.
2. The app will calculate your numerology number and provide an interpretation.

## Example

```bash
Enter your birthdate (DD-MM-YYYY): 12-05-2003
Your numerology number is: 3
Interpretation: You are a creative and expressive person with a strong artistic flair.
```

## How it works

The numerology number is derived by adding the digits of the birthdate until a single digit is obtained. For example:

- For the birthdate `12-05-2003`, the sum is: `1 + 2 + 0 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 13` (and then `1 + 3 = 4`).
